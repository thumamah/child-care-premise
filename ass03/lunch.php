                    <p>All children in childcare need regular healthy meals, snacks and fluids (drinks). Promoting children’s health is an important aspect of good quality childcare. It’s important that children in care are offered nutritious meals and enjoy positive mealtime experiences.</p>
                    <p>Food provided in childcare has an important role to play in the growth and development of children and in the development of future eating habits. In long day childcare centres, menus should aim to meet a significant amount of a child’s daily nutrition requirements. A variety of foods such as vegetables, fruits, cereals, lean meat, fish, chicken, milks, yoghurts and cheeses should be provided to children in care, including a range of textures and tastes, appropriate to the developmental stages of different age groups.</p>
                    <p>The mealtime atmosphere and the attitude and behaviour of childcare workers is important to the development of healthy eating practices. Children should be relaxed and happy when they are eating. Meals are often shared with carers and other children. Childcare workers should develop and encourage healthy eating patterns and positive attitudes to food and also supervise children’s eating. Children learn from others about food preferences and how to eat. Safety at mealtimes is important. </p> 
                    <p>From a young age, kids get to learn a lot of new things. And when they travel in school buses, they not just make new friends, but they learn sharing, companionship and how to make new friends.These things will help them for years to come. For school going kids’, school bus is usually the best place where they get to meet new kids and make friends.</p>
