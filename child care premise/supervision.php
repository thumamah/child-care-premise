                        <p>Supervision is an integral part of the whole care and
                            education experience. At its most basic level,
                            supervision helps to protect children from hazards or
                            harm that may arise in their daily experiences in
                            play, interactions with others, and daily routines.
                            Adequate supervision means that an adult can
                            respond immediately including when a child is
                            distressed or is in a hazardous situation.
                            Supervision is constantly observing and relating to
                            individual children and groups of children to contribute
                            to their safety and wellbeing.</p>
                        <p>Supervision involves more than preventing or
                            responding to potential or actual hazards or harm. It
                            requires the staff member to be actively involved with
                            children and have knowledge of what each child is
                            doing at any given time of the day. Through
                            supervision staff member get to know each child and
                            develop essential understandings about them in the
                            social setting of the children’s service.</p>
                        <p>Thoughtful supervision of children creates
                            opportunities to assess each child’s strengths and
                            interests and ways of relating to other children and
                            adults. These assessments are valuable
                            contributions to planning the program. Sharing
                            assessments with families, with others responsible for
                            the child and with the children themselves is important (for example, in school holiday care
                            services with school staff). This helps to builds
                            partnerships and increase understanding of children.</p>

                        <p> Supervision can contribute to building positive
                            relationships between staff member and children.
                            When children are being supervised adequately,
                            there will be evidence of strong, mutually respectful
                            relationships between staff member and children.</p>
